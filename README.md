# Spring Boot Admin Panel - Tests

This is a sample project used for testing [spring-boot-database-admin](https://github.com/aileftech/spring-boot-database-admin).

You can clone this project, run it and visit [http://localhost:8080/dbadmin](http://localhost:8080/dbadmin) to check how it works.

Notice that the only code here is the `@Entity` classes, there are no controllers or repositories because they are all automatically
created.
